## SmartPeerJS: A library for turning smarpthone in interactive controller  

### Project description 
Virtually everyone has a smartphone nowadays. This project aims to harness the large array of sensors smartphones offer to create remote controllers that do not require any expensive equipment or software installations. The idea is to turn any phone into a controller such as a joystick, a NES controller, a voice control or hand tracker, by scanning a single QR code on a webpage. <br />

This project will build on my summer project: https://github.com/EmmaPoliakova/WebRTCSmartphoneController and https://github.com/EmmaPoliakova/smartpeer. This was focused on creating demos to illustrate the idea of a website controlled by smartphone. The goal is now to create an open-source library that packages the code needed to establish the peer-to-peer communication between the computer and phone websites and simplify the process of creating new types of smartphone controllers. A special attention will be given to allow multi-controller capabilities to the end-users of this library. We will continue using WebRTC technology to avoid any server cost for the user of this library.
