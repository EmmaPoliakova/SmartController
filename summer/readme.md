## Research completed
The summer project was focusing on finding out if a smartphone could connect to a PC browser via peer to peer connection and act as a controller. The original idea was to use the smartphone camera only. This would send a video stream into the browser which could run hand tracking or basic object recognition on it. I have done research on PeerJS which provides the peer to peer connection, hand tracking libraries such as Handpose and MediaPipe, npm modules and Webpack bundler. 

## Ideas developed
I have developed several demos demonstrating proof of concept of using a smartphone as a website controller. These include a platformer and a racing game, sandbox world with blocks and physics engine and a hand tracking demo. They can be found <a href= 'https://github.com/EmmaPoliakova/WebRTCSmartphoneController'> here. </a> 

## Concerns or risks identified
The hand tracking demo was too slow and inaccurate so the attention shifted from a video stream to other sensors as means of input.
